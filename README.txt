This project was made by
Evan, Jarred, and Wesley

The development process was honestly quite long
Getting rails and routes to work is hard
I am glad to have done it
Rails is incredibly hard to use on Windows


Everything should run as expected
Rails version used was 3.3.7
I personally used RubyMine
and rails s to run it
